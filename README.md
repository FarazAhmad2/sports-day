- 100m race with randomized timings and scoring
- Long jump with a random winner and scoring
- High jump with user input for the winner and scoring
- Award ceremony to declare winners and scores

- The event system uses setTimeout to simulate the timing of each event.
- Callback functions are used to handle the asynchronous flow of the event.
- Scores are updated dynamically based on the outcome of each event.
